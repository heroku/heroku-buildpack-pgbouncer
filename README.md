# Heroku buildpack: pgbouncer

This is a [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) that
allows one to run pgbouncer and stunnel in a dyno alongside application code.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with other buildpacks as part of a
[multi-buildpack](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi).

The primary use of this buildpack is to allow for transaction pooling of
PostgreSQL database connections among multiple workers in a dyno. For example,
10 unicorn workers would be able to share a single database connection, avoiding
connection limits and Out Of Memory errors on the Postgres server.

It uses [stunnel](http://stunnel.org/) and [pgbouncer](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgBouncer).


## FAQ
- Q: Why should I use transaction pooling?
- A: You have many workers per dyno that hold open idle Postgres connections and
and you want to reduce the number of unused connections. [This is a slightly more complete answer from stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12189162/what-are-advantages-of-using-transaction-pooling-with-pgbouncer)

- Q: Why shouldn't I use transaction pooling?
- A: If you need to use named prepared statements, advisory locks, listen/notify, or other features that operate on a session level.
Please refer to PGBouncer's [feature matrix](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgBouncer#Feature_matrix_for_pooling_modes) for all transaction pooling caveats.


## Disable Prepared Statements
With Rails 4.1, you can disable prepared statements by appending
`?prepared_statements=false` to the database's URI.  Set the
`PGBOUNCER_PREPARED_STATEMENTS` config var to `false` for the buildpack to do
that for you.

Rails versions 4.0.0 - 4.0.3, reportedly can't disable prepared statements at
all. Make sure your framework is up to date before troubleshooting prepared
statements failures.

Rails 3.2 - 4.0 also requires an initializer to properly cast the
prepared_statements configuration string as a boolean. This initializer is
adapted from [this
commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e54acf1308e2e4df047bf90798208e03e1370098).
In file config/initializers/database_connection.rb insert the following:

```ruby
require "active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter"

class ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter
  alias initialize_without_config_boolean_coercion initialize
  def initialize(connection, logger, connection_parameters, config)
    if config[:prepared_statements] == 'false'
      config = config.merge(prepared_statements: false)
    end
    initialize_without_config_boolean_coercion(connection, logger, connection_parameters, config)
  end
end
```


## Usage

Example usage:

    $ ls -a
    .buildpacks  Gemfile  Gemfile.lock  Procfile  config/  config.ru

    $ heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git

    $ cat .buildpacks
    https://github.com/gregburek/heroku-buildpack-pgbouncer.git#v0.3.3
    https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby.git

    $ cat Procfile
    web:    bin/start-pgbouncer-stunnel bundle exec unicorn -p $PORT -c ./config/unicorn.rb -E $RACK_ENV
    worker: bundle exec rake worker

    $ git push heroku master

The buildpack will install and configure pgbouncer and stunnel to connect to
`DATABASE_URL` over a SSL connection. Prepend `bin/start-pgbouncer-stunnel`
to any process in the Procfile to run pgbouncer and stunnel alongside that process.


## Multiple Databases
It is possible to connect to multiple databases through pgbouncer by setting
`PGBOUNCER_URLS` to a list of config vars. Example:

    $ heroku config:add PGBOUNCER_URLS="DATABASE_URL HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_ROSE_URL"
    $ heroku run bash

    ~ $ env | grep 'HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_ROSE_URL\|DATABASE_URL'
    HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_ROSE_URL=postgres://u9dih9htu2t3ll:password@ec2-107-20-228-134.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5482/db6h3bkfuk5430
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://uf2782hv7b3uqe:password@ec2-50-19-210-113.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5622/deamhhcj6q0d31

    ~ $ bin/start-pgbouncer-stunnel env # filtered for brevity
    HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_ROSE_URL=postgres://u9dih9htu2t3ll:password@127.0.0.1:6000/db2
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://uf2782hv7b3uqe:password@127.0.0.1:6000/db1

## Follower Replica Databases
As of v0.3.2 of this buildpack, it is possible to use pgbouncer to connect to
multiple databases that share a database name, such as a leader and follower.
To use, add the follower's config var to `PGBOUNCER_URLS` as detailed in the
[Multiple Databases](#multiple-databases) section.

If you are using [Octopus](https://github.com/tchandy/octopus)
[Replication](https://github.com/tchandy/octopus#replication) to send reads to
a replica, make sure to include the color url of your leader in the
`SLAVE_DISABLED_FOLLOWERS` blacklist. Otherwise, Octopus will attempt to use
your leader as a read-only replica, potentially doubling your connection count.

## Tweak settings
Some settings are configurable through app config vars at runtime. Refer to the appropriate documentation for
[pgbouncer](http://pgbouncer.projects.pgfoundry.org/doc/config.html#_generic_settings)
and [stunnel](http://linux.die.net/man/8/stunnel) configurations to see what settings are right for you.

 Ensures that stunnel will work correctly after a dyno resumes from sleep. Otherwise, the dyno will lose connectivity to RDS.
